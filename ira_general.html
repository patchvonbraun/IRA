</UL>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">A recent install of <I>Gnu Radio</I> is
also required—see <A HREF="http://www.gnuradio.org/">http://www.gnuradio.org</A>
for build and installation instructions.  IRA requires access to a
source tree, since it makes some minor customizations to <I>Gnu Radio</I>
to facilitate IRA performance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Other
Hardware Requirements</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><I>IRA </I>requires a USRP1 (<A HREF="http://www.ettus.com/">http://www.ettus.com</A>)
for its radio interface, along with the daughter-card(s) that are
appropriate for the operating frequencies. The DBS_RX, for example,
allows observing over the 950MHz to 2300Mhz frequency range, which
happens to include both the <I>Hydrogen line</I>, and several of the
<I>Hydroxyl</I> lines. The TV_RX card allows observing in the 50MHz
to 800Mhz region. A high-quality USB cable rated for USB 2.0 use is
required between the USRP1 and the computer platform.</P>
<P>In some circumstances an external down-converter can be used, with
the IF output from the down-converter feeding a BASIC_RX or LF_RX
card. Several modern all-band receivers have wide IF outputs that
allow them to be used to down-convert UHF and microwave frequencies
to 10.7MHz or some other intermediate frequency that is in range for
the BASIC_RX and LF_RX cards (approximately 100Hz to 30Mhz). It is
<I>vitally important </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">that the
down-converter has a feature that disables </SPAN><I>Automatic Gain
Control</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(AGC). Without the
ability to disable AGC, radio astronomy </SPAN><I>continuum</I>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">observations cannot be usefully
conducted, since the down-converter/receiver will tend to
compress-out any slight variations in received signal power (which is
precisely what a </SPAN><I>continuum</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">observation
is all about).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Antenna Requirements</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The type and size of antenna
required for successful observations is determined largely by the
types of observations that are to be performed. Solar observations at
UHF frequencies and higher, for example, can usually be conducted
using smaller parabolic-dish antennas. For example, at 12GHz, using a
standard TVRO </SPAN><I>Low Noise Block Down-converter Feed-horn</I>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(LNBF), successful solar
observations can be conducted using a dish of approximately 60cm
diameter, at lower frequencies a larger dish is required, since the
thermal component of the solar radio noise increases with increasing
frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">For observing weaker sources,
including pulsars, spectral lines, etc, larger antennas are required.
For example at 21cm, the </SPAN><I>Hydrogen Line </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">can
be observed using a dish of as little as 1.3M diameter, while sources
such as </SPAN><I>Cygnus A, Casseopia A, Sagittarius A</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">require
a dish of at least 2 to 2.5M diameter.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">For pulsars at low UHF frequencies
(300MHz to 500Mhz), a dish of at least 3.8M diameter is required to
successfully observe a handful of the most powerful pulsars.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Observing Site
Requirements</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Just as optical astronomical
observations require clear access to the sky, so do radio
observations. Trees, hills, buildings, and other obstructions will
completely block most of the radio waves that are arriving from the
cosmos. It is important, therefore to choose an observing site that
is clear of obstructions, to within at least 20 degrees of the
horizon, but less horizon blockage is always better!</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Most observations cannot be
conducted within large built-up areas such as large cities, due to
the overwhelming amount of local-produced </SPAN><I>Radio Frequency
Interference </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(RFI). It is
sometimes possible to conduct observations at the higher microwave
frequencies (4GHz and higher) from within a built-up area, but
generally over a smaller section of sky, that avoids local
terrestrial interference sources.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Your observing site should have
stable power, both for the computer, and the USRP. For some types of
instruments, such as a </SPAN><I>Meridian Transit</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">radio
telescope, observations may be conducted over very long time
periods--having a power failure interrupt such an observing “run”
can be very frustrating.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Other things to consider</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><I>Front-end Gain and noise figure</I></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">It is typically the case that the
receiving apparatus (USRP and computer) are located at some distance
from the dish itself (indeed, proper RFI hygiene virtually </SPAN><I>commands</I>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">that this be so). For this reason,
the gain of the </SPAN><I>low-noise amplifier</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(LNA)
chain out at the antenna needs to be able to adequately compensate
for RF cable loss between the antenna and other receiving apparatus.
Typically, amplifiers with gain totalling 25dB or more are used in
situations with long cable runs.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Since the signals arriving from
the cosmos are </SPAN><I>extremely weak,</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">it
is important that the first gain stage in the receiving system
(whether an LNA or an LNBF) have a very low </SPAN><I>noise figure</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.
Noise figures below roughly 0.8dB provide acceptable performance.
Sometimes the performance of a low-noise device is quoted in terms of
</SPAN><I>noise temperature.</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">In
this case, temperatures below roughly 60K are considered adequate for
radio astronomy observations for small observatories. Very often
manufacturers will quote a noise temperature that seems impossibly
low—they'll quote the lowest temperature they were able to achieve
in the lab, rather than the typical or average temperature. If a
device manufacturer claims a noise temperature below 25K, it is very
likely that “typical” devices will have a noise temperature 8-15K
higher.</SPAN></P>
<P><I>Gain stability</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Apart from the noise issues, and the
overall gain issues there is another <B>extremely important</B> issue
when considering front-end hardware for a small radio observatory.
The overall system stability, in terms of gain or detected signal
strength determines the quality and reliability of observations made
of the weaker sources. Indeed, the variation in gain of a system can
often exceed the detector variation caused by a source! The two
factors that dominate gain stability in low-noise amplifiers are
power-supply stability, and temperature stability.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Ensure that whatever power-supply is
being used for the front-end components (LNAs and line amplifiers) is
very, very stable. Use a supply that is larger than is required for
the anticipated load, by a factor of three or four. Generally,
linear-regulated power supplies, with large filter capacitors are
preferred over switching power supplies, which tend to produce
unwanted RF noise.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">If possible, the front-end electronics
should be mounted to a heavy aluminum plate, with the entire
assembly, including the feed-horn(s) enclosed in an insulated
enclosure. White polystyrene foam of 22mm or greater thickness is an
excellent material for this purpose. Polystyrene foam is also quite
transparent to most RF, so it can be safely used <B>in front </B>of
the feed-horn. Packing the spaces inside the enclosure with loose
polystyrene packing material can also help with thermal stability of
the front end.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In some circumstances, active thermal
control of the entire front-end can be used to achieve excellent
system gain stability, at a cost of adding complexity to an already
complex system. Both heating and cooling systems can be considered.
Heaters, for example, are easier to use, and if actively controlled
with a temperature set-point a few degrees above the
seasonally-adjusted ambient temperature, they can be very useful.
Heating <B>does</B> add a small penalty in noise figure, but if you
start out with an already-excellent noise temperature, it will only
be degraded <B>very slightly</B> by using a heater to stabilize the
LNA temperature above ambient by a few degrees.</P>
<P><I>Feed-line loss</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Feed-lines are lossy, more so at higher
frequencies than lower frequencies. Keep the feed-lines as short as
is practical, and consider burying them, to improve their temperature
stability. It is the  case that feed-line loss factors change with
temperature, so stabilizing the temperature of your feed-line, by
burying it, can be a very wise investment.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">With adequate consideration given
to weather-proofing, the USRP system can be moved out to the antenna
itself, drastically reducing the amount of feed-line (and therefore,
loss) that must be used. Systems using this technique must use a
USB-2.0 extender. Contact <A HREF="mailto:sales@science-radio-labs.com">sales@science-radio-labs.com</A>
for more information about our recommended USB-2.0 extender, and its
limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P><I>Lightning Protection</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In many parts of the world, lightning
is hazard that must be considered when designing an observing system.
If RG-6 feed-lines are used, high-quality in-line lightning arrestors
are available from nearly-any do-it-yourself TVRO satellite store,
and there are a number of such stores that have on-line ordering
available. These units are rugged, and can asborb a large number of
induced-current “hits” without needing to be replaced.
Furthermore, they're usually available for under USD$5.00 each.</P>
